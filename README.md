Files of video LTspice #18: BLDC Motor: Dynamic Modelling

Available at: BLDC Motor: Dynamic Modelling

This video shows how to obtain a dynamic model for the brushless DC (BLDC) motor. From the model we can derive the important transfer functions of the motor, the control transfer function: speed versus dc voltage, and the perturbation transfer function: speed versus load torque. The video also illustrates how to verify the model by LTspice simulations using the BLDC motor LTspice model developed in previous videos.
